## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is a piece of code that you create, that can be reused and called upon in multiple instances

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts ("#{name} I am")
end
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
hello_someone("Larry")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
Methods look like very powerful tools. I would love to see some more intermediate examples of all methods can do, and how they can be used beyond math.
