## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

Conditional statements are used to perform and action if certain criteria are met for example

if x or y = 1 then do z
if a and b = c  then do z
if a or b = c then do z

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

To tell the computer to check on the status of variables, and act on those variable if the correct conditions are met.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if x == 1
  puts "This is the correct syntax"
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You can also use elsif and else under the original if conditional

if the 'if' statement isn't met then the computer moves to check the elsif

if that is also not met then it moves to check the else

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

if x > 2
  puts "Greater than 2"
elsif x < 2
  puts "Less than 2"
else
  puts "Its probably 2"
end


1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

We can use a while statement to have something running continuously while we wait to see if a certain criteria is met
